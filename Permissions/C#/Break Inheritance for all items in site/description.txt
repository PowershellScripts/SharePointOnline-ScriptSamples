A little console application that stops inheriting permissions for all the items in a site collection. It is equivalent of the button "Stop Inheriting Permissions" in the Permission Settings for a document/library or a site.


The code breaks inheritance in:
-files
-list items
-folders
-subfolders and their content
-lists and libraries
-sites/subsites


 


It does NOT remove the permissions! The permissions remain as they were.


It will NOT stop inheriting permissions in:


- root site collection for the collection  (by design). It will delete unique permissions for all the CONTENT of a site collection


- list and libraries which exceeded the limit of 5000 items (by design)




 

At the end a simple report will be generated in C:\Users\Public

 

Below you can find full function reponsible for the breaking permission inheritance - don't hesitate to improve and comment on it in the Q&A section!
