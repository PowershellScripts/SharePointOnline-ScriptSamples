# SharePointOnline-ScriptSamples

Over 260 SharePoint Online scripts 
* fixing issues
* generating reports 
* extra settings not available via UI
* bulk updates
* provide automation script samples to address IT Pros' frequently asked IT tasks.

The scripts use Powershell, C#, CSOM and REST. They include copies of existing scripts from Technet Gallery years 2013-2019.

Most of them were tested and verified by hundreds and thousands of users of [Technet Gallery](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/site/search?f%5B0%5D.Type=User&f%5B0%5D.Value=Arleta%20Wanat) 

Their new home at GitHub is still relatively recent, so if you find any issues, please do let me know. I appreciate every comment and every feedback.

Have an idea for a useful script? Can't find it here? Open an issue and let's discuss it together!
